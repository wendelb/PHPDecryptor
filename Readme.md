# PHPDecryptor

This is a projevt to show how to collect submitted data. The data is generated by an internal (meaning not publicly available) application.

## Request-Format

The data will be sent to the following endpoint:
```
http://localhost/studenten/info.php?data=<BASE64 encoded and encrypted data>&signature=<HMAC signature>
```

The data is a JSON Object which is encrypted by mcrypt (PHP) using AES256-CBC. There is also a 32 Bytes Initialization Vector (IV). IV and Ciphertext are then concatenated and encoded using Base64.

The purpose of this application is to check the incoming data, decrypt it, decode the JSON and show all containing data.
